What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialise a repo a new .git repo is created that lets you make commits to code files. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The working directory is the place where all the files are stored. Once you do a git add on those files, 
	they become tracked files and are a part of the staging area. Then, once you commit, the changes to the 
	repository are made.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
